# Known Issues and Bugs

Auto-Refresh Requirement: Currently, the system might require a manual page refresh to reflect updates in real-time. We're actively working on improving this behavior to ensure that changes are immediately visible without needing a page reload.

UI Responsiveness: The user interface may not be fully responsive on all screen sizes and devices. We're planning to enhance the UI to ensure a better experience across a wider range of platforms.

Security Note: While the system is functional, it's essential to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place, especially when deploying in a production environment.
